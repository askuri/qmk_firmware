# Askuri's keymap

This README also serves as a reference for myself about QMK in general.

## Compiling and flashing

I have configured a default keyboard and keymap, so following commands are sufficient:
* qmk compile
* qmk flash

## How is QMK installed?

I believe it's installed via Pip (Python): `python3 -m pip install --user qmk`

The actual QMK installation is in `~/qmk_firmware`.
